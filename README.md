# NetStylus

NetStylus transforms your Windows pen-enabled tablet into a drawing tablet for another device.

At the moment, I tested it only with my Microsoft Surface, and I wrote a server only for Linux (with libevdev).
However, the "protocol" is straightforward and can be easily implemented also in other platforms.

The project is at a proof-of-concept level, but it does what it needs. I do not think I am going to add features/improve the ugly GUI soon.

If you want more information about how I wrote it, feel free to check [this article](https://www.pierov.org/2021/02/19/netstylus/ "this article") on my website.
